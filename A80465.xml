            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:113047:2"/>
            <p>On the ≈øaid Munday <hi>Iune</hi> the 16. Sir <hi>Thomas Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax</hi> lay before <hi>Leice≈øter</hi> and ≈øent in a Summons to the Towne, to require the Governour to ≈øurrender it to him for the u≈øe of the Parliament; and putting it to them to con≈øider how the King was routed, and ≈øhewing them what u≈øe they might make of that Clemency, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other very gallant expre≈ø≈øions to the ≈øummons, to adverti≈øe them how much better it was for them to ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render then to force him to take it by ≈øtorming.</p>
            <p>To this ≈øummons the Enemy ≈øent a negative An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer, po≈øitively this, that they would not ≈øurrender it; whereupon Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> called a Councell of Warre to con≈øult about the Storming of it, which was ≈øoon concluded on; that they ≈øhould prepare all things in readine≈ø≈øe to round it the next day: which was done with all expedition not loo≈øing any time.</p>
            <p>So they fell pre≈øently to rai≈øing of Batteries, and doing all things that were nece≈ø≈øary for the ≈øtorming thereof according as they had appointed, and continued providing every thing that had appointed, and continued providing every thing that was requi≈øite for the doing thereof, to be in a readine≈ø≈øe to batter it the next day, and ≈øent into the Country thereabouts for ≈øuch helpes as were nece≈ø≈øary for the worke, which went on with great ≈øpeed both night and day; ≈øo de≈øirous wee are to have a ≈øpeedy end of the worke that there may be an end of the≈øe warres if po≈ø≈øible.</p>
            <p>On Tue≈øday the 17. th of <hi>June,</hi> wee drew downe our Ordnance and playd with our Pieces again≈øt the Towne, we ≈øtormed it playing with our Ordnance very hot on the <hi>Newarke</hi> ≈øide, which we conceived was their greate≈øt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113047:3"/> ≈øtrength? And in ≈øhort time we made a breach in their workes, which ≈øtrucke ≈øuch a terror into the hearts of the Enemy, that the Governour ≈øent to us to de≈øtre a Parley, and offered to ≈øurrender upon very faire termes; as upon capitulation ≈øhould be agreed upon.</p>
            <p>To this reque≈øt (Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> being willing to ≈øave the ≈øpilling of innocent blood as much as may be) he a≈ø≈øented: and promi≈øed ≈øpeedily to ≈øend in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øioners for the treaty, and called a Councell of warre and it was agreed that Collonel <hi>Pickering,</hi> and Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Rein≈øoorough</hi> ≈øhould go into <hi>Leicester</hi> to treat with the Governour about the ≈øurrendring the ≈øaid Garri≈øon to Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax.</hi> And accordingly a ≈øafe conduct was de≈øired for them, which being ≈øent they went to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulate with the Governour about the ≈øurrender there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>In the meane time Sit <hi>Thomas Farfax</hi> was not idle, nor did he loo≈øe any time; but went on providing and furni≈øhing him≈øelfe with Pittars, Carts, Hay, Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, Ladders, and all other things nece≈ø≈øary for ≈øtorm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; re≈øolving to fall on at their returne, in ca≈øe that they ≈øhould not agree, not knowing how things might fall out, during which time there was both great paynes and care taken by all in their places for the going on in the ≈øayd worke.</p>
            <p>In the meane time we had Intelligence that the King was on Munday the 16 of <hi>Iune</hi> at <hi>Sheffield;</hi> that he came from <hi>A≈øh by de la zouch</hi> thether with about 2000 hor≈øe, or more, the day before, <hi>viz.

            <p>About 11 of the clocke on Munday morning, they marched from thence to <hi>Sturbridge,</hi> where he had ≈øome more Hor≈øe came in, ≈øo that in all it is conceived that hee is nigh 4000.

            <p>The King it is believed will for <hi>Worce≈øter,</hi> and there joyne with what Forces <hi>Gerhard</hi> can releeve him with, and ≈øome more Forces that hee lookes for out of the We≈øt; but Collonel <hi>Gerhard</hi> hath met with a rout al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo in <hi>Shrop≈øhire,</hi> where he lo≈øt almo≈øt 400 men, by figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the Countrey forces, and the Governour of <hi>Worce≈øter</hi> was killed, and divers other Officers of note were ≈øl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
